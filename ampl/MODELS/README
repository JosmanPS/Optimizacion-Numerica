Most of the model and data files in this directory are from the AMPL
book.  The bigprod.mod, dist.*, egypt.mod, il.* and train*.* files are
derived from Computing Science Technical Report 133 ("AMPL:  A
Mathematical Programming Language", by Fourer, Gay, and Kernighan;
AT&T Bell Laboratories, Jan. 1987, revised June 1989).  Both dist.*
and egypt.mod are too big for the Student Edition to handle, but they
contain interesting constructs.

Score.mod is another example of piecewise-linear terms with a varying
number of breakpoints.

Distnode.mod is a node-and-arc variant of dist.mod.

Pgon.mod and p2gon.mod are for an interesting nonlinear
optimization problem:  find an n-gon inscribed in the
unit circle and having maximal area.  Surprisingly, the
solution is irregular for even n.  See "The Largest Small
Hexagon" by R. L. Graham [J. Combinatorial Theory (A), 18 (1975),
pp. 165-170].

Files mps*.mod and awk scripts m2a and m2ai permit converting
MPS files into AMPL input.

Directory nlmodels is a collection of nonlinear models assembled
by Elena Bobrovnikova.

File data contains just "data;" and lets you type such command-
lines as
