#   "A strategy for global convergence in a sequential 
#    quadratic programming algorithm",
#   SINUM 26(3), pp. 600-623, 1989.

#   The problem as stated in the paper seems to contain a typo.
#   The sign of the x3 squared term in the first constraint has been
#   set to + instead of - in order to ensdure that the problem is 
#   bounded below and the optimal point stated recovered.

#   The problem is not convex.
