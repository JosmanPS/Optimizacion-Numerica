#   P.T. Boggs and J.W. Tolle,
#   "A strategy for global convergence in a sequential 
#    quadratic programming algorithm",
#   SINUM 26(3), pp. 600-623, 1989.

#   The problem as stated in the paper seems to contain a typo.
#   In order to make the second constraint feasible at the proposed 
#   solution, the sign of x2 in the second constraint has been set 
#   to - instead of +.

#   The problem is not convex.
